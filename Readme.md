# Overview

The Stratton report is an application that allows a user to purchase a lift ticket, and check the latest weather conditions on the mountain using the OpenWeather API.

When a ticket is purchased, the user has the opportunity to enter in various data points, including an opt in to recieve an email or SMS. The opt in triggers a flow in the Klaviyo platform to notify the user on the day of their ski ticket of the latest weather conditions on the mountain.
